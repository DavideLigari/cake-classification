# Cake  classification

This project focuses on image recognition using two approaches: one utilizing hand-crafted image features processed by a classification model, and the other employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that directly processes image pixels. The main objective of this project is to improve classification accuracy for cake image recognition. The project involves refining existing lab activity scripts and performing additional exercises to explore different techniques and models for image recognition.

## Approach 1: Hand-Crafted Image Features

In this approach, hand-crafted image features are extracted and processed by a classification model. The lab activity provides a starting point for building classifiers using low-level features. These features are further analyzed, and exercises such as combining different features and analyzing class confusion are performed. The aim is to enhance the classification accuracy by experimenting with different combinations of features and understanding the strengths and limitations of this approach.

## Approach 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The second approach involves utilizing a CNN to directly process image pixels. The project utilizes the 'PVMLNet' CNN architecture (a slight simplification over the AlexNet) to extract neural features from cake images. Transfer learning is explored by replacing the last layer of PVMLNet with a trained perceptron. Additionally, different hidden layers are examined to determine their effectiveness in extracting relevant features for accurate classification.

## Additional Exercises

In addition to refining the lab activity scripts, this project includes various exercises to further explore image recognition techniques. These exercises may include:

- Combining different types of features (hand-crafted and neural features) to improve classification accuracy.
- Analyzing class confusion to identify challenging cake categories and potential areas for improvement.
- Exploring different hidden layers in the neural network to identify the most informative layers for feature extraction.

The project aims to enhance the overall image recognition accuracy by experimenting with different techniques, models, and features.
